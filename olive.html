                            <p>And I thought: Please not another self-optimization tool, that seems to help but actually just makes the user feel miserable. Does the world need another calorie tracker?</p>
                            <p>So for me I already saw problematic frames, that I wanted to adress in my project.

                            <p>A conversation with a good friend came into my mind from some years ago. I was telling her I was often not feeling great, and she asked me what I was doing that specific day.<br>
                            After I told her my daily tasks, she fastly answered: „You did not feed all of your chicken!“<br>
                            I looked at her with big questioning eyes, when she laughed and continued: „Your health is like three chickens. One has the name 'body', one has the name 'mind' and one has the name 'soul'. For being happy and healthy you have to feed every single one of them. The body-chicken you feed with healthy food and activity. The mind-chicken you feed with education and learning something new. The soul-chicken you feed with gratefulness and family and friends.“ And indeed on that specific day when I was miserable, I did not feed those chickens.</p>

                    <p>* For this project I have also created a User Journey for Timo, where  his need for a trustable source for education and guidelines is at the center of attention. Furthermore, the Task Analysis is dedicated to this feature, as well as the User Flow. Additional to the shown task for Sandra, I also created a Task Analysis and a User Flow for the task “Add a doctor to profile”.</p>

                            <p>The card sorting also revealed the participants had very different feelings to group the features into categories. It went from only two groups to five groups. This gave me the freedom to sort the features customized to the health tree and in which scenario it was better to use more categories.</p>

This would be the home button and every navigation would lead via the big health tree in the home screen. This would give the device a clear task flow and puts the tree in the center of attention.</p>

                            <p>One observation in the usability testings were the participants were looking for a home button in the heading of the screen. Therefore nearly all of the participants used a path with the back button to reach the home screen.</p>
                            <p>By bringing the actual <span>home button to the head of screen</span> I went after the intuition of my participants. In the next step I reworked the task flows and was able to <span>remove the back button</span>, so the user only has the option to use the actual home button. This simplified the user flow immense and ensured a frictionless usability. By downsizing the button and bring it to the left corner of the screen I also won more spacing in the header, which allowed me to <span>add a heading with the category and icon</span>.</p>
                            <p>With the new iterations I reacted on issue 1 and issue 2 of the usability tests.</p>

                            <p>Next steps for a further developement would be:</p>

                                <li><p>the medical area and fitness section need to be developed</p></li>

                            <p>The original product does not ask very much about the user's profile, to allow the Timo-Personas under us fast access to the app. But by using the medical area the user would be asked about a <span>medical profile to ensure personalized recommendations</span>.</p>
                            <p>This profile can even include the possibility to <span>change the feature selection</span> that the heath tree offers. What if one persona suffers from OCD or depression, are there methods that would provenly help such users? </p>
                            <p>Or: Should branches be addable or removable? How far can the health tree grow? Should the application start with a small plant at first? What else rewarding could be implemented instead of the shown animations?</p>
